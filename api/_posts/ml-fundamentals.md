## What is Machine Learning?

At its core, **Machine Learning (ML)** gives computers the ability to learn from experience without being explicitly programmed. Instead of writing code with hard-coded rules, we feed data to an algorithm and let it learn patterns.

## Core Concepts

The two most common types of ML are Supervised and Unsupervised Learning.

### 1. Supervised Learning
You train a model on a dataset that is **labeled**, meaning you know the "correct" answer for each data point.

* **Example**: Training a model to predict house prices. You provide features like square footage (input) and the corresponding sale price (output label).
* **Common Algorithms**: Linear Regression, Decision Trees.

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
You work with a dataset that is **unlabeled**. The algorithm must find hidden patterns or structures on its own.

* **Example**: Customer segmentation. An e-commerce site could use it to group customers based on their purchasing behavior.
* **Common Algorithms**: K-Means Clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
