## Why Use TypeScript with React?

Combining React's powerful component-based architecture with TypeScript's static typing creates a robust development experience. Here's why:

* **Catch Errors Early**: TypeScript flags type-related errors in your editor before you even run the code.
* **Smarter Autocompletion**: Your editor can provide incredibly accurate suggestions for props, state, and functions.
* **Improved Readability**: Explicit types act as documentation, making your code easier to understand and maintain.

## Typing a Functional Component

Let's look at a simple `UserProfile` component. First, we define a type for our component's props.

```tsx
// Define the shape of the props object
type UserProfileProps = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  isLoggedIn: boolean;
};

const UserProfile = ({ name, age, isLoggedIn }: UserProfileProps) => {
  if (!isLoggedIn) {
    return <p>Please log in to view the profile.</p>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{name}</h2>
      <p>Age: {age}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default UserProfile;
