## Introduction

Node.js is a fantastic choice for building fast and scalable APIs due to its non-blocking, event-driven architecture. Here are some best practices to follow.

## 1. Structure Your Project Logically

As your application grows, group your code by feature. A common approach is to separate routes, controllers (logic), and services (business rules).

```plaintext
/src
  /api
    /users
      - user.routes.js
      - user.controller.js
      - user.service.js
